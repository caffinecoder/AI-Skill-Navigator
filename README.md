 AI Skill Navigator

## Project Description
Personalized career guidance platform powered by AI that analyzes your GitHub projects, skills, and career goals to provide actionable recommendations for professional growth


## Team Information
**Team Name:** LLMates
**Team Members:**
- Sharmista J 

## Hackathon Theme Addressed
**Theme 1: Outbound Apps - Build a purposeful AI Agent**

Our solution directly addresses Theme 1 by implementing Descope's Outbound Apps to securely manage external API credentials and tokens. The application demonstrates seamless integration with:
- **GitHub API** - For repository analysis and profile data
- **OpenAI API** - For AI-powered career analysis and recommendations

## What We Built + How to Run It

### Architecture Overview
The AI Skill Navigator consists of three main components:

1. **Frontend Application** (`frontend/`)
   - Responsive web interface built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
   - Descope Web Component integration for authentication
   - Real-time repository visualization and analysis results

2. **Flask Backend** (`app.py`)
   - RESTful API with secure JWT-based authentication
   - Integration with OpenAI GPT-4 for intelligent career analysis
   - Descope Outbound Apps integration for external API management

3. **MCP Server** (Model Context Protocol)
   - Additional integration layer for advanced AI workflows
   - Shared analysis functions between Flask and MCP implementations

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Node.js (for local development server)
- OpenAI API key
- Descope project credentials

### Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd ai-skill-navigator
   ```

2. **Install Python Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   DESCOPE_PROJECT_ID=P31lWtDeYzgqh6jCiC3fZB61zVdF
   DESCOPE_MANAGEMENT_KEY=your_descope_management_key
   FLASK_ENV=development
   ```

4. **Start the Backend Server**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   The Flask server will start on `http://localhost:5000`

5. **Serve the Frontend**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   # Using Python's built-in server
   python -m http.server 3000
   # OR using Node.js
   npx serve . -p 3000
   ```
   The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## Authentication Note
I implemented Descope with GitHub/Google outbound apps (client IDs configured), but encountered integration issues during deployment. For demo purposes, I've included a placeholder login. The full Descope integration is code-complete but requires additional configuration.
